                    Hello! 
                    I’m Aaliyah, a 27-year-old Egyptian living in China. My native language is Arabic, and I’m fluent in English and Chinese.                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My journey with Chinese began in 2014 when I first heard the language. Unlike many, I instantly fell in love with how it sounded. That fascination stayed with me through my final school years until, in 2016, I decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Chinese Language and Literature.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As a writer, I was often frustrated by my inability to fully express my thoughts in English. I’ve always felt that English, as a language, sometimes fails to capture the depth of emotion and thought I want to convey. So, I searched for a language with more layers, and what better choice than what’s often considered the mother of Asian languages?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 2017, I joined a summer camp organized by Cairo University’s Confucius Institute and attended classes at Peking University. While others were bidding farewell to Beijing on the last day, I knew my story with this country had only just begun. A year later, I spent a year at Zhejiang University on a Confucius Institute scholarship. After graduating top of my class from Cairo University, I was awarded the Chinese Government Scholarship and returned to China in 2023 to pursue a master’s degree in Communication at Nanjing University.

                <p>
                    Living in China has taught me far more than any textbook ever could. My curiosity to experience “real China” led me to spend Chinese New Year with a family in Chongqing and to attend a wedding in a small village — two of my most cherished experiences that allowed me to see China through Chinese eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These moments made me realize how misleading media portrayals can be, and how important it is to witness authenticity firsthand. That desire inspired my first adventure series, “The Girl Without a Map,” where I wandered around Nanjing (and nearby cities) without using maps or setting destinations — letting people, intuition, and chance guide me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, my second series, “Diaries of Chinese Streets,” began when I overheard a mother’s simple words to her child — trivial, yet they lingered in my mind all day until I wrote them down. It reminded me how everyday moments can hold quiet beauty.
                </p>

                    I’m now working as a social media manager for Western media in Hangzhou, China. Transitioning from student to professional life abroad has been a leap, but one filled with growth and learning.
