                    “Photography”, created from Greek roots and translates to writing with light. I knew this very recently, and it got me thinking about how similar photography is to writing. Writing and photography are both tools for us to express ourselves when words we utter fail to convey how we truly feel. 

                    <br><br>I read somewhere that technology has made good writers better and bad writers worse, and I can say the same with photography. It is so easy now to bring out your phone, take a picture of the pretty place and use an app to edit your picture in 2 minutes. It will look pretty, but it will feel empty, as empty as the texts we send each other on SNS. 
                    
                    <br><br>As someone recently advised me, “good photographers aren’t the ones who take pictures of the already pretty stuff, but the ones who make beauty out of the ordinary.” 
                    
                    <br><br>So, I will take my time here… to learn how to make beauty out of the ordinary.

                    “Why Chinese?”
Two words; sounding incredibly simple to answer, yet every time I feel like needing
endless amount of hours to answer such question. Let me try to summarize the thoughts that
are now flooding my mind and try to put this as simply as this question sounded.

                    <br><br>Why Chinese? Because, Chinese is, for me, as eloquent as a language can ever be.
From the way this language sounded so melodic the first time I heard it to the way its
characters more look like embellishment on papers.
                    <br><br>Why Chinese? Because Chinese is as historical as it gets.
Our fascination with history can be affirmed by the existence of archaeologists and
their never-ending explorations to fill in the gaps we all have when picturing our ancestors.
Our absolute mesmerisation with history can be easily detected with the number of lines
queued up in front of museum gates in hopes of catching a glimpse of ancient times. We still
cling and hold onto the smallest historical findings.
                    <br><br>It’s not so different from novels that narrate fictional stories about the bewilderment
old scholars face when they happen to stumble upon a magical door that brings them to the
future. We’re as equally astonished with the past, and I’m pretty sure if I were to go back in
time, I would’ve walked with my mouth similarly agape.
Luckily enough, Hanzi could be considered one of the rarest historical findings that
displays a small glimpse of the human minds before any kind of modernization; the simplest
and most rudimentary state possibly the human minds beheld.
                    <br><br>And that’s what I believe to be the most interesting aspect in Hanzi; the ability to
relate to some of the characters. I remember my first writing class, and how giddy I was as I
detected the characters that symbolized nature and how my smile widened each time I
guessed a meaning right.
                    <br><br>Before the scientifically shaped alphabets from the ‘A’ to the "ي", our primitive
minds came up with unsophisticated shapes to help them record what they believed was
important to reserve for generations and generations to come. Countries like Egypt, Iraq and
China were ones that created very simple shapes to help them turn their thoughts tangible.
Although Pharaohs might have been the first to come up with the idea of recording their most
important life events, China was surely the one that succeeded to maintain the ‘oldest
surviving writing system’.
The earliest confirmed evidence was Jiaguwen from late Shang Dynasty. Jiaguwen
can be explained as the Chinese characters carved on tortoise shells and animals bones. The
scripts were later identified as communication between the king and his ancestors on topics
relating to military success, royal family and ritual sacrifices by means of Scapulimancy
                <br><br>Thankfully, ancient Chinese scholars were clever and wise enough to use such
materials and surfaces to write down what they believed was most important to be accorded.
It is widely believed that once existed insignificant events that were written on various
wooden surfaces ended up decaying into nothingness.
Of course, one would wonder, how China succeeded to keep its writing system
without being affected. The answer is simple and perhaps a bit shocking; complete isolation.
                <br><br>When each country was slowly forced to surrender, losing control over its own seclusion and
with the ever growing technology sweeping us all on its back and taking over our lives, China

was one of the very few (if not the only one) that stood still on its grounds without being
affected. This gained China its title of being one of the strongest countries throughout history.
                <br><br>Until very recently, China was not as eager about cultural exchange as the rest of the
world was. I think they feared cultural exchange would only lead to changing the path their
own ancestors and history would’ve guided them through, and perhaps on the long run, end
up abandoning their beliefs and customs as happened with other civilizations. If there’s one
thing I surely admire about this country, it’s definitely its sense of treasuring its own identity
and traditions.
This doesn’t mean that Hanzi didn’t face the slightest bit of changing. On the
contrary, Chinese characters ever since the Jiaguwen have evolved.
                <br><br>Other than changes in the shaping of the character, the number of syllables used to
establish words have also changed throughout the years. Before, they focused on
monosyllable words, unlike recent years where they use polysyllable characters.
Most of the foreign Chinese beginner learners have no information about Hanzi, and
often get confused between the difference between simplified and traditional Chinese
characters. The difference between the two writing styles lies in the number of strokes each
have, with the latter having more number of strokes.
                <br><br>From caring about the beauty of calligraphy to the dire need of simplification, the
Chinese characters undergone various changings and is believed to witness more in the
future. Luckily, China started to wisely take the needed measurements to make learning this
language easier for foreigners like how it, very recently, created Pinyin which facilitates
memorizing words and understanding pronunciation.
                <br><br>The longevity of Hanzi is still questionable for there hasn’t been a solid evidence that
could lead us to the exact birth of these characters. Mythology, regarding this department,
was quite interesting. Like most languages, myths existed to explain its creation. Stories
varied from supernatural guidance to spiritual help from the almighty.
                <br><br>Scientists, for me, where even more humouring for they struggled to find needed
evidence that could backup their theories. Topics concerning this subject surfaced and some
were argued/agreed on, yet there wasn’t a special one that managed to steal the lights and
shush all the questions and doubts aroused throughout decades.
                <br><br>I’d like to believe that the mystery of its birth only nags those who can’t see the
beauty of Hanzi. Whether it is years or decades from now, no scientific research would be
able to find exact explanation and analysis for these characters for their creation can only be
described as artistry. Somewhere, during a time our modernized minds can only fantasize
about, contemplating enlightened he, whose creativity was triggered, and itched those
fingertips of his to create this exquisite style of writing.

                    Ever since I started learning Chinese, I have repeatedly heard this sentence: we learn languages to remove the "communication" barrier between people". 
To be completely honest with you, although I have heard this sentence thousand times, I have never felt or understood the actual meaning of it or its importance. 

                    <br><br>Until one day.. 
                    
                    <br><br>I had a class with this certain kid. Before he arrived, the secretary gave me details about the class and what I am supposed to teach him. She had a look of annoyance on her face as she spoke because he was known to have a very poor level in English, and that I was going to teach him from a book that he had already been taught before. Why was that? Well it is because he was THAT bad in English, his level wasn't witnessing any kind of improvement, and she blamed the mom for not letting her kid study well at home. 
                    
                    <br><br>Fast forward to the class time, while I was teaching the little kid the lesson, he was staring at me with no reaction. Whenever I said some sentence or a grammar rule, he would just read after me when I instruct him to, but I could tell that he clearly didn't understand what I was teaching him. 
So, I innocently stopped halfway and asked him what the word (he) meant. He didn't answer, until I asked again the same question but in chinese. His eyes widened as soon as I spoke in Chinese, and he then answered (in Chinese), it means 父亲
I was dumbfounded. He didn't know the basic of the basics. 
So I asked about the meaning of another word, to which he also answered wrong. 

                    <br><br>t dawned on me then that whoever was teaching him, was giving him sentences. And since the teacher didn't speak chinese, the kid had to figure out the rough meaning of the words by understanding the whole sentence. (Does it make any sense to you?) 
I then wrote the pronouns on the board with their translation in Chinese on the side. And then every word I would utter, I would write on thr board in Chinese for him to understand what it actually meant. 
                    <br><br>Now.. the reason to why I am writing all of this, is just because of this moment. 
It is this moment that I started writing each word with its meaning in Chinese that his face just lit up. I swear I saw his whole face changing as soon as he saw the words written on the board. 
The expression on his face was one that says "I finally understand."
I never felt more proud of anything I have done before like in that moment. It was this moment that made me realize how absolutely amazing it is to learn a language. It was the moment that I realized what "break the communication barrier" actually meant.
                    <br><br>I am writing this for the people who study languages, and more to myself, as a reminder of our importance in this world. In a country where people like me who major in languages and not "important" majors like engineering and medicine, I am here to tell you that what you are doing is as important and as meaningful as everyone else. 
                    <br><br>While the doctor saves a life, an engineer builds a roof over heads, you bring light to one's mind and make distances less longer.
